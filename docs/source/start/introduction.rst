Differential Thermal Analysis
-----------------------------

Differential thermal analysis (DTA) is a thermal analysis technique that involves measuring
the difference in temperature between a sample and reference material, as both are heated/cooled
under identical, controlled conditions.

A sample materials undergoing a phase transition - such as crystallisation or melting - as both 
it and the (inert) reference are heated, will result in a temperature delta between the two, which
can be measured and plotted as a function of the sample's temperature.

In doing so, DTA can be used to determine both the temperature at which a phase transition occurs,
as well as the enthalpy of the transition, by accounting for the heat capacities of the sample advanced
reference.
