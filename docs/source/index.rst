DIY Differential Thermal Analyser Project documentation
===================================

Introduction
------------

This documentation covers the design and use of a low cost Differential Thermal Analyser (DTA) instrument, developed as a part of a MSc Project at the University of Birmingham.

The aim of the project is to develop a DTA instrument that can be used in typical undegraduate labs, to analyse the properties and behaviour of a reasonable diverse range of 
polymer materials, as a lower entry alternative to more expensive commercial instruments.

The design therefore makes extensive use of off-the-shelf parts, integrated with free, open source software, to provide a low cost, easy to build and intuitive to use DTA instrument.

It also provides a platform for further development, having been designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for the easy integration of further features and capabilities.

Contents

The documentation covers three key topics:

* :doc:`build` - Instructions for building and setting up the instrument
* :doc:`usage` - Instructions for basic use of the instrument
* :doc:`api` - API documentation for the software
